# AirBnB_clone - The console

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

This is the first step towards building my first full web application: the AirBnB clone.
This first step is very important because I will use what I build during this project with all other following projects: 
HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help me to:
<ol>
  <li>put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances</li>
  <li>create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file</li>
  <li>create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel</li>
  <li>create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.</li>
  <li>create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine</li>
</ol>
